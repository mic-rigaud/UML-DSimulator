This folling link to www.eclipse.org should be commented out
or removed in final version of the 
"web version" of the readme, since it does not make sense to 
have there. But in the "product's readme" it will point people 
to "the latest version" since there _might_ be changes made 
after the release.

</h2>
<h2 id="TargetOperatingEnvironments"><a class="mozTocH2"
 name="mozTocId311932"></a>Target Operating Environments</h2>
<p>In order to remain current, each Eclipse Project release targets
reasonably current operating environments.</p>
<p>Most of the Eclipse SDK is "pure" Java code and has no direct
dependence on the underlying operating system. The chief dependence is
therefore on the Java Platform itself. Portions are targeted to
specific classes of operating environments, requiring their source code
to only reference facilities available in particular class libraries
(e.g. J2ME Foundation 1.1, J2SE 1.4, Java 5, etc).</p>
<p>In general, the 4.6 release of the Eclipse Project is developed on
Java SE 8 VMs. As such, the Eclipse SDK as a whole is targeted at all
modern, desktop Java VMs.</p>
<p> <a href="#appendix">Appendix 1</a> contains a table that indicates
the class library level required for each bundle. </p>
<p> There are many different implementations of the Java Platform
running atop a variety of operating systems. We focus our testing on a
handful of popular combinations of operating system and Java Platform;
these are our <em>reference platforms</em>. Eclipse undoubtedly runs
fine in many operating environments beyond the reference platforms we
test. However, since we do not systematically test them we cannot vouch
for them. Problems encountered when running Eclipse on a non-reference
platform that cannot be recreated on any reference platform will be
given lower priority than problems with running Eclipse on a reference
platform. </p>
<p> Eclipse 4.6 is tested and validated on a number of reference
platforms. For the complete list, see <a
 href="https://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?planurl=http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/eclipse_project_plan_4_6.xml#target_environments">Target
Environments in the 4.6 Plan</a>. </p>
<p> As stated above, <i>we expect that Eclipse works fine on other
current Java VM and OS versions but we cannot flag these as reference
platforms without significant community support for testing them.</i> </p>
<p>The Eclipse SDK is designed as the basis for internationalized
products. The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK
components, including dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The
English strings are provided as the default resource bundles.</p>
<p>Latin-1, DBCS, and BiDi locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on
all reference platforms.</p>
<p>The Eclipse SDK supports GB 18030 (level 1), the Chinese code page
standard, on Windows, Linux and the Macintosh.</p>
<p>German and Japanese locales are tested.</p>
<h2 id="Compatibility"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId356713"></a>Compatibility
with Previous Releases</h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId760552"></a>Compatibility of
Release 4.6 with 4.5</h3>
<p>Eclipse 4.6 is compatible with Eclipse 4.5 (and all earlier 3.x
versions).</p>
<p> <strong>API Contract Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 4.6 is
upwards contract-compatible with Eclipse SDK 4.5 except in those areas
noted in the <a
 href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/porting/eclipse_4_6_porting_guide.html"
 target="_top"> <em>Eclipse 4.6 Plug-in Migration Guide</em> </a>.
Programs that use affected APIs and extension points will need to be
ported to Eclipse SDK 4.6 APIs. Downward contract compatibility is not
supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with Eclipse SDK 4.6
APIs would ensure compliance with Eclipse SDK 4.5 APIs. Refer to <a
 href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs"> <em>Evolving
Java-based APIs</em> </a> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes
that maintain contract compatibility. </p>
<p> <strong>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 4.6
is upwards binary-compatible with Eclipse SDK 4.5 except in those areas
noted in the <a
 href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/porting/eclipse_4_6_porting_guide.html"
 target="_top"> <em>Eclipse 4.6 Plug-in Migration Guide</em> </a>.
Downward plug-in compatibility is not supported. Plug-ins for Eclipse
SDK 4.6 will not be usable in Eclipse SDK 4.5. Refer to <a
 href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs"> <em>Evolving
Java-based APIs</em> </a> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes
that maintain binary compatibility. </p>
<p> <strong>Source Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 4.6 is upwards
source-compatible with Eclipse SDK 4.5 except in the areas noted in the
<a
 href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/porting/eclipse_4_6_porting_guide.html"
 target="_top"> <em>Eclipse 4.6 Plug-in Migration Guide</em> </a>.
This means that source files written to use Eclipse SDK 4.5 APIs might
successfully compile and run against Eclipse SDK 4.6 APIs, although
this is not guaranteed. Downward source compatibility is not supported.
If source files use new Eclipse SDK APIs, they will not be usable with
an earlier version of the Eclipse SDK. </p>
<p> <strong>Workspace Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 4.6 is
upwards workspace-compatible with earlier 3.x and 4.x versions of the
Eclipse SDK unless noted. This means that workspaces and projects
created with Eclipse SDK 4.5, 4.4, 4.3, 4.2, ... 3.0 can be
successfully opened by Eclipse SDK 4.6 and upgraded to a 4.6 workspace.
This includes both hidden metadata, which is localized to a particular
workspace, as well as metadata files found within a workspace project
(e.g., the .project file), which may propagate between workspaces via
file copying or team repositories. Individual plug-ins developed for
Eclipse SDK 4.6 should provide similar upwards compatibility for their
hidden and visible workspace metadata created by earlier versions; 4.6
plug-in developers are responsible for ensuring that their plug-ins
recognize metadata from earlier versions and process it appropriately.
User interface session state may be discarded when a workspace is
upgraded. Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. A

<p> <strong>Non-compliant usage of API's</strong>: All non-API methods
and classes, and certainly everything in a package with "internal" in
its name or x-internal in the bundle manifest entry, are considered
implementation details which may vary between operating environment and
are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly
depend on anything other than what is specified in the Eclipse SDK API
are inherently unsupportable and receive no guarantees about
compatibility within a single release much less with earlier releases.

to Use the Eclipse API</em> </a> for information about how to write

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId178265"></a>Installation/Configuration
issues that can cause Eclipse to fail start</h4>
<p>Here are some common problems that can cause Eclipse not to start:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As shown <a href="#TargetOperatingEnvironments">above</a>,
Eclipse 4.6 requires at least a Java SE 8. Perhaps an older version of
the VM is being found in your path. To explicitly specify which VM to
run with, use the Eclipse <code>-vm</code> command-line argument. (See
also the <a href="#RunningEclipse">Running Eclipse</a> section below.)
  </li>
  <li>Running Eclipse on Gentoo Linux may result in the following error
message:
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <code> * run-java-tool is not
available for sun-jdk-1.6 on i686<br>
* IMPORTANT: some Java tools are not available on some VMs on some
architectures </code> </div>
If this occurs, start Eclipse by specifying a -vm argument, either
specify the path to a java vm or use: <code>eclipse -vm `java-config</code>
--java` (bug <a
 href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=176021">176021</a>)
  </li>
  <li>Eclipse must be installed to a clean directory and not installed
over top of a previous installation. If you have done this then please
re-install to a new directory. If your workspace is in a child
directory of your old installation directory, then see the instructions
below on "<a href="#Upgrading">Upgrading Workspace from a Previous
Release"</a>. </li>
  <li>Java sometimes has difficulty detecting whether a file system is
writable. In particular, the method java.io.File.canWrite() appears to
return true in unexpected cases (e.g., using Windows drive sharing
where the share is a read-only Samba drive). The Eclipse runtime
generally needs a writable configuration area and as a result of this
problem, may erroneously detect the current configuration location as
writable. The net result is that Eclipse will fail to start and
depending on the circumstances, may fail to write a log file with any
details. To work around this, we suggest users experiencing this
problem set their configuration area explicitly using the <code>-configuration</code>
command line argument. (bug <a
 href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=67719">67719</a>) </li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId229730"></a> <b>Invalid
characters in install directory prevents Eclipse from starting</b> </h4>
<p> Eclipse will fail to launch if installed in a directory whose path
contains certain invalid characters, including :%#&lt;&gt;"!. The
workaround is to install Eclipse in a directory whose path does not
contain invalid characters. (bugs <a
 href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3109">3109</a> and
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17281">17281</a>)
</p>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId662536"></a>Hanging during class
loading when out of permanent generation memory</h4>
<p> The Oracle JVM may hang indefinitely during class loading if it
runs out of permanent generation memory. This will cause CPU usage to
stay at 100% until the process is ended. See the section <a
 href="#RunningEclipse">Running Eclipse</a> for details on addressing
this VM problem. </p>
<h3 id="I-General-GCJ"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId710344"></a>General
- GCJ</h3>
<p>GCJ is an effort by the GCC team to provide an open source Java
compiler and runtime environment to interpret Java bytecode.
Unfortunately, the GCJ runtime environment is not an environment that
is often tested on by Eclipse developers.</p>
<p>The most common problems surrounding GCJ are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eclipse does not start at all</li>
  <li>Eclipse throws a 'java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
org.eclipse.core.runtime.Plugin' that can be found in the logs (located
in workspace/.metadata/.log)</li>
</ul>
<p>The workspace's log file is a good place to check to identify
whether GCJ is being used or not. Every Eclipse log session is
prepended with information about the runtime environment that was used
to run Eclipse. The log may include something like the following:</p>
<code>java.fullversion=GNU libgcj 4.2.1 (Debian 4.2.1-5)</code>
<p> If Eclipse does start, one can check which runtime environment is
being used to run Eclipse by going to <b>Help &gt; About Eclipse SDK
&gt; Installation Details &gt; Configuration</b>. The <b>About</b>
dialog itself can also provide other information, the build identifier
can be of particular interest as it is tagged by some distributions.
This allows the user to identify whether Eclipse was downloaded through
the distribution's package management system or directly from the
eclipse.org web site. </p>
Eg: <code>Build id: M20070212-1330 (Ubuntu version: 3.2.2-0ubuntu3)</code>
<p>The two most common workarounds are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>download the Eclipse binary from eclipse.org directly</li>
  <li>run Eclipse using an alternate Java runtime environment</li>
</ul>
<p>To download Eclipse, try one of the links below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/</a></li>
</ul>
It is imperative that 64-bit builds are downloaded and used if a 64-bit
Java runtime environment has been installed. Below are two sample
tarball names of version 4.6 of the Eclipse SDK packaged for 32-bit and
64-bit processors.
<pre>eclipse-SDK-4.6-linux-gtk.tar.gz (32-bit)<br>eclipse-SDK-4.6-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz (64-bit)</pre>
<p>To run Eclipse with an alternate Java runtime environment, the path
to the Java virtual machine's binary must be identified. With an
Eclipse installation from the distribution, altering the $PATH variable
to include the path to the alternate Java runtime environment is often
not enough as the Eclipse that Linux distributions package often
performs a scan internally to pick up GCJ by itself whilst ignoring
what's on the $PATH. An example of the terminal's output is shown below:</p>
<code> searching for compatible vm...<br>
testing /usr/lib/jvm/java-gcj...found </code>
<p>Once the path to the virtual machine's binary has been identified,
try running Eclipse with the following command:</p>
<code>./eclipse -vm /path/to/jre/bin/java</code>
<p>For an actual example, it might look something like the following:</p>
<code> ./eclipse -vm /usr/lib/jvm/sun-java-6/bin/java<br>
./eclipse -vm /opt/sun-jdk-1.6.0.02/bin/java </code>
<p>If this seems to solve the problem, it is likely that the problem
really was related to the use of GCJ as the Java runtime for running
Eclipse. The eclipse.ini file located within Eclipse's folder can be
altered to automatically pass this argument to Eclipse at startup. An
example of its content is presented below:</p>
<code> -showsplash<br>
org.eclipse.platform<br>
-vm<br>
/opt/sun-jdk-1.6.0.02/bin/java<br>
-vmargs<br>
-Xms40m<br>
-Xmx512m </code>
<p> Note that every argument must be on its own line. More information
about the eclipse.ini file can be found at <a
 href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini">http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini</a>.
</p>
<p> If problems persists after downloading an installation of Eclipse
from eclipse.org and using a supported Java runtime environment (a list
of which may be found <a href="#TargetOperatingEnvironments">above</a>),
you can seek further assistance through the <a
 href="https://www.eclipse.org/forums/">forums</a>, the IRC <a

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId3915"></a>Problems with
classloaders in created threads</h4>
<p> There is a known issue with trying to load classes from a
newly-created thread using a class loader different from the plug-in
class loader. The result will be a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a workaround, do the following: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a thread in which to run your code.</li>
  <li>Send yourThread.setContextClassLoader(yourClassLoader); // you
can find your classloader by grabbing a class it loaded
(YourPluginClass.class.getClassLoader())</li>
  <li>Run your code in the newly created thread.</li>
</ol>
<p> If you set the context class loader for the current thread, you are
competing with other users of the thread (all of Eclipse), so the
results will be unpredictable. However, there should be no problem in
practice provided you reset the context class loader back to its
original value when your use in the current thread is&nbsp;complete.

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId148431"></a>Potential Problems
Converting Plug-in Manifests</h4>
<p> If your plug-in ships with a plug-in manifest and not an OSGi
bundle manifest, is shipped as a JAR file, and contains a nested JAR
file then there may be problems in the automatic generation of the
bundle manifest file. The packages defined in the nested JAR may not be
exported correctly in the <code>Export-packages</code> bundle manifest
header. To work around this you should ship your plug-in with a bundle
manifest. (bug <a

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId544740"></a>Location for Debug
Options File on Mac OS</h4>
<p> If you are running in debug mode on Mac OS, the default location
for the .options file is inside the application bundle in the
Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS directory (like the eclipse.ini). (bug <a
 href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=88782">88782</a>) </p>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId341887"></a>Issues with JNI that
use FindClass</h4>
<p> There may be issues when using a JNI implementation that uses
FindClass in a function where the JNIEnv pointer is not available, such
as in a C callback (bug <a
 href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=125250">125250</a>).
The reason is that FindClass, in this case, uses the application class
loader to find the class. If the desired class is in the classpath used
for the application classloader (e.g. defined by the VM argument -cp
&lt;classpath&gt;), as it would typically be in a stand-alone
application, there is no problem. However, under Eclipse, the
application classloader does not have access to classes contained in
plug-ins. Eclipse uses its own class loader to find classes contained
in plug-ins. </p>
<p>The proper plug-in class loader is used by FindClass in JNI
functions which are passed the JNIEnv pointer, but not when you have to
use AttachCurrentThread to get the JNIEnv pointer. In this case the
application classloader is used.</p>
<p>For example, the following will fail because AttachCurrentThread is
used to get the JNIEnv pointer:</p>
<pre>static JavaVM* jvm;  // Global variable<br><br>void myCallback(void) {<br>    JNIEnv* env;<br>    jvm-&gt;AttachCurrentThread((void**)&amp;env, NULL);<br>    // Fails if some/class is not in the application classloader:<br>    jclass cls = env-&gt;FindClass("some/class");<br>    jmethodID methodID = env-&gt;GetMethodID(cls, "methodName",<br>      "(Ljava/lang/String;)V or whatever signature");<br>    env-&gt;CallVoidMethod(callback, methodID, ...);<br>    jvm-&gt;DetachCurrentThread();<br>  }<br>}<br></pre>
<p>A solution is to cache the method ID, for example:</p>
<pre>static jmethodID mid;  // Global variable<br><br>JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL JNI_OnLoad(JavaVM *vm, void *reserved) {<br>...<br>  // Store the JavaVM pointer<br>    jvm = vm;<br><br>  // Find the class and store the method ID<br>  // Will use the class loader that loaded the JNI library<br>    jclass cls = env-&gt;FindClass(className"some/class");<br>    if(!cls) goto ERR;<br><br>    mid = env-&gt;GetMethodID(cls, "methodName",<br>      "(Ljava/lang/String;)V or whatever signature");<br>    if(!mid) goto ERR;<br>...<br>}<br><br>void myCallback(void) {<br>    JNIEnv* env;<br>    jvm-&gt;AttachCurrentThread((void**)&amp;env, NULL);<br>    env-&gt;CallVoidMethod(callback, mid, ...);<br>     // Handle error ...<br>    jvm-&gt;DetachCurrentThread();<br>  }<br>}<br></pre>

must be provided in a separate JAR that is contributed to the <code>org.eclipse.ant.core.antTasks</code>

is because of a known problem with GTK3/Xinput2 and can be worked
around by setting the environment variable <code>"GDK_CORE_DEVICE_EVENTS=1"</code>
before running the application. Note that this workaround is not
necessary for Eclipse (as the launcher already sets it) but is needed
for other SWT based applications. (bug <a

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId593797"></a>CVS server
compatibility</h4>
<p>The CVS plug-in parses messages returned from the CVS server. If the
format of these messages is not as expected, some of the plug-in's
functionality may be missing. The CVS plug-in is compatible with all
stable 1.11.X builds of the CVS server, and should be compatible with
future releases in that stream unless text message formats change (the
last tested server was 1.11.22). As for the 1.12.X feature releases of
CVS, the Eclipse CVS client has been tested with builds up to 1.12.13.
However, future releases could easily break the Eclipse CVS client.
Basic functionality, such as Checkout, Commit, and Update, should
always work, but there may be problems with more advanced commands such
as Synchronizing and Browsing the repository.</p>

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId760232"></a>Breakpoints
unreliable running Sun 1.6.0_14</h4>
Developers debugging applications on Sun's 1.6.0_14 virtual machine
should be aware that breakpoints are unreliable (i.e. do not always
suspend execution). The problem occurs on Windows and Linux platforms.
This is an issue with the VM and not with Eclipse. The workaround is to

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId573670"></a>Cannot run or debug

<p> Most class libraries do not properly support the creation of a
system process (via <code>java.lang.Runtime.exec(...)</code> ) when
the specified command line contains GB18030 characters. This limitation
means the debugger cannot launch applications when the command line it
generates contains GB18030 characters. (bug <a

<p> Most class libraries do not properly support the creation of a
system process (via <code>java.lang.Runtime.exec(...)</code> ) when
the specified command line contains GB18030 characters. Since Javadoc
is created using the Javadoc executable provided with the JDK,
generating Javadoc fails if the package or class name contains GB18030
characters. (bug <a

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId27992"></a>Unable to debug stack
overflows</h4>
<p> If a debug session suspends on a <code>java.lang.StackOverflowError</code>
exception (due to an exception breakpoint), the debugger may not be
able to retrieve any debug information from the target JVM. As well,
the debugger may not be able to reliably interact with the target JVM
past this point. (bug <a
 href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19217">19217</a>) </p>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId970095"></a>Evaluation limitation</h4>
<p> The debugger uses threads in the target JVM to perform evaluations
(both explicit evaluations that the user requests, and implicit
evaluations such as <code>toString()</code> invocations in the <b>Variables</b>
view). The Java Debug Interface (JDI) requires that the thread in which
an evaluation is performed be suspended by a user event (that is, a
breakpoint or step request). Evaluations cannot be performed on threads
suspended by the suspend action. As well, when a breakpoint is
configured to suspend the JVM rather than just the individual thread,
the threads which did not encounter the breakpoint are not in a valid
state to perform an evaluation. When an evaluation is attempted in a
thread that is not in a valid state to perform an evaluation, an error
message will appear to the effect of "Thread must be suspended by step
or breakpoint to perform method invocation". (bug <a
 href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=34440">34440</a>) </p>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId698026"></a>Missing debug
attributes</h4>
The debugger requires that class files be compiled with debug
attributes if it is to be able to display line numbers and local
variables. Quite often, class libraries (for example, " <code>rt.jar</code>
") are compiled without complete debug attributes, and thus local
variables and method arguments for those classes are not visible in the
debugger.
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId11693"></a>Using Hot Code Replace</h4>
<p>Hot code replace is supported on JDK 1.4.x VMs, and IBM J9 VMs. The
debugger will attempt to replace all class files that change in the
workspace as the user edits and builds source code. However, hot code
replace is limited to changes that a particular virtual machine
implementation supports. For example, changes within existing methods
may be supported, but the addition or removal of members may not be.</p>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId736358"></a>Scrapbook</h4>
Setting a breakpoint inside a scrapbook page is not supported.
<p> When a snippet is run in the scrapbook which directly or indirectly
calls <code>System.exit(int)</code> , the evaluation cannot be
completed, and will result in a stack trace for a <code>com.sun.jdi.VMDisconnectedException</code>
being displayed in the scrapbook editor. </p>
<p> Terminating a scrapbook page while it is performing an evaluation
results in a <code>com.sun.jdi.VMDisconnectedException</code> being
displayed in the scrapbook editor. </p>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId233701"></a>Debugging over slow
connections</h4>
A global Java debug preference specifies the debugger timeout, which is
the maximum amount of time the debugger waits for a response from the
target VM after making a request of that VM. Slow connections may
require that this value be increased. The timeout value can be edited
from the <b>Java &gt; Debug </b>preference page. Changing the timeout
value only affects subsequently launched VM, not VMs that are already
running.
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId550867"></a>Updating of inspected
values</h4>
When inspecting the result of an evaluated expression in the debugger,
it is important to note that the result displayed is the result of that
expression at the time it was evaluated. For example, when inspecting a
simple integer counter (primitive data type), the value displayed in
the Expressions view is the value when the expression was evaluated. As
the counter is changed in the running program, the inspected result
will not change (since the view is not displaying the value bound to a
variable - it is displaying the value of an expression, and the value
of a primitive data type cannot change). However, if an expression
results in an object, fields of that object will be updated in the
inspector as they change in the running program (since the value bound
to fields in an object can change).
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId579316"></a>Stepping over native
methods that perform I/O</h4>
When the debugger steps over native methods that perform I/O to <code>System.out</code>
or <code>System.err</code> , the output may not appear immediately
unless the native performs a flush on the output buffer.
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId513966"></a>VM and process
termination running on IBM 1.3 JVM on Linux (Linux only)</h4>
Terminating a launch, debug target, or system process associated with a
debug target running on the IBM 1.3 JVM on the Linux platform does not
work when the associated debug target has a suspended thread. To remove
such debug targets from the debug UI, select <b>Terminate and Remove</b>
from the debug view's pop-up menu (or use the shortcut "delete" key).
Associated system processes in the OS may not be properly cleaned up.
If a debug target has no suspended threads, termination works properly.

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId726887"></a>Java Annotation
Processing</h4>
<p> Some methods in the processing API are unimplemented when compiling

<p> Java 6 annotation processors are supported in the batch compiler

source zips of some plug-ins</h4>
<p> In the plug-in import wizard, when you choose to import plug-ins as
"projects with source folders", PDE will not unzip the source for the
org.apache.ant. This is because the source ZIPs contains code that will
not compile when unzipped as it requires additional JARs that are not
part of the SDK. To avoid the creation of plug-in projects that won't
compile, PDE will import these plug-ins as binary and attach source, so
you would still be able to read the source, you just won't be able to
modify it. Also, PDE will not unzip the source for the org.eclipse.swt
plug-ins. In this case, it is because, when shipped, the swt code is
spread across a plug-in and a fragment, and when unzipped, it will
require circular dependencies between the plug-in and fragment
projects. These circular dependencies are at minimum marked as warnings
by the JDT compiler and may result in unpredictable build behavior.
Therefore, PDE always imports org.eclipse.swt as binary with source
attached. (bug <a

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId723029"></a>Reusing a workspace
after changing architectures silently breaks PDE models</h4>
<p> If a workspace is reused on a machine with a different
architecture, the PDE models used to build plug-ins may silently fail.
To work around this problem, delete the metadata in
&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core. (bug <a

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId923139"></a>Missing @since tag
API Tools problems on interface fields containing @noreference tag</h4>
<p> The Eclipse platform 4.6 release will not allow the API Tools
@noreference tag on interface fields. This was changed because all
interface fields are constant fields that cannot support the
@noreference restriction. The tag was allowed in previous releases and
this usage will now be considered an API change requiring a @since tag.
It is recommended that you create an API Tools filter for the missing
@since tag problem. This filter can be removed as soon as the API
baseline has been regenerated. (bug <a

</p>
<h2 id="RunningEclipse"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId420991"></a>Running
Eclipse</h2>
<p> After installing the Eclipse SDK in a directory, you can start the
Workbench by running the Eclipse executable included with the release
(you also need a Java SE 8 JRE, not included with the Eclipse SDK). On
Windows, the executable file is called <samp>eclipse.exe</samp> , and
is located in the <code>eclipse</code> sub-directory of the install.
If installed at <code>c:\eclipse-SDK-4.6-win32</code> , the executable
is <code>c:\eclipse-SDK-4.6-win32\eclipse\eclipse.exe</code> . <b>Note:</b>
Set-up on most other operating environments is analogous. Special
instructions for Mac OS X are listed <a href="#macosx">below</a>. </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId230700"></a>Allocating enough
memory and solving OutOfMemoryErrors</h3>
<p> By default, Eclipse will allocate up to 1024 megabytes of Java heap
memory. This should be ample for all typical development tasks.
However, depending on the JRE that you are running, the number of
additional plug-ins you are using, and the number of files you will be
working with, you could conceivably have to increase this amount.
Eclipse allows you to pass arguments directly to the Java VM using the <code>-vmargs</code>
command line argument, which must follow all other Eclipse specific
arguments. Thus, to increase the available heap memory, you would
typically use: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <code>eclipse -vmargs -Xmx&lt;memory size&gt;</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> with the <code>&lt;memory size&gt;</code> value set to greater
than "1024M" (1024 megabytes -- the default). </p>
<p>Note that setting memory sizes to be near or larger than the amount
of available physical memory on your machine will cause Java to
"thrash" as it copies objects back and forth to virtual memory, which
will severely degrade your performance.</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId196879"></a>Selecting a workspace</h3>
<p> When the Workbench is launched, the first thing you see is a dialog
that allows you to select where the workspace will be located. The
workspace is the directory where your work will be stored. If you do
not specify otherwise, Eclipse creates the workspace in your user
directory. This workspace directory is used as the default content area
for your projects as well as for holding any required metadata. For
shared or multi-workspace installs you must explicitly specify the
location for your workspace using the dialog (or via the " <code>-data</code>
" command line argument). </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId266563"></a>Specifying the Java
virtual machine</h3>
<p>Here is a typical Eclipse command line:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <code>eclipse -vm c:\jdk6u22\jre\bin\javaw</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <i>Tip:</i> It's generally a good idea to explicitly specify which
Java VM to use when running Eclipse. This is achieved with the " <code>-vm</code>
" command line argument as illustrated above. If you don't use " <code>-vm</code>
", Eclipse will look on the OS path. When you install other Java-based
products, they may change your path and could result in a different
Java VM being used when you next launch Eclipse. </p>
<p>To create a Windows shortcut to an installed Eclipse:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <code>eclipse.exe</code> in Windows Explorer and use
Create Shortcut on the content menu. </li>
  <li>Select the shortcut and edit its Properties. In the Target: field
append the command line arguments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Opening this shortcut launches Eclipse. (You can drag the shortcut
to the Windows Desktop if you want to keep it in easy reach.)</p>
<h3 id="macosx"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId228378"></a>Mac OS X</h3>
<p> On Mac OS X, you start Eclipse by double clicking the Eclipse
application. If you need to pass arguments to Eclipse, you'll have to
edit the <code>eclipse.ini</code> file inside the Eclipse application
bundle: select the Eclipse application bundle icon while holding down
the Control Key. This will present you with a popup menu. Select "Show
Package Contents" in the popup menu. Locate <code>eclipse.ini</code>
file in the <code>Contents/Eclipse</code> sub-folder and open it with
your favorite text editor to edit the command line options. </p>
<p> On MacOS X you can only launch a UI program more than once if you
have separate copies of the program on disk. The reason for this
behavior is that every UI application on Mac can open multiple
documents, so typically there is no need to open a program twice. Since
Eclipse cannot open more than one workspace, this means you have to
make a copy of the Eclipse install if you want to open more then one
workspace at the same time (bug <a
 href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=139319">139319</a>).
</p>
<p>If you need to launch Eclipse from the command line, you can create
a symbolic link such as "eclipse". It should point to the eclipse
executable inside the application bundle and takes the same arguments
as "eclipse.exe" on other platforms.</p>
<p>On Mac OS X 10.4 and later, you may notice a slow down when working
with significant numbers of resources if you allow Spotlight to index
your workspace. To prevent this, start System Preferences, select the
Spotlight icon, then the Privacy tab, then click the Add button ("+")
and find your workspace directory in the dialog that appears.</p>
<h3 id="SharedInstall"><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId788467"></a>Shared
Install</h3>
<p> The startup speed of a shared install can be improved if proper
cache information is stored in the shared install area. To achieve
this, after unzipping Eclipse distribution, run Eclipse once with the
"-initialize" option from an account that has a write access to the
install directory. See <a
 href="%20http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fmisc%2Fmulti_user_installs.html">shared
installs</a> in Eclipse Help for more information. </p>

Operating System Requirements</h3>
<h4 id="SpecialOSRequirementsAIX"><a class="mozTocH4"
 name="mozTocId576803"></a>AIX</h4>
<p>In order for this version of Eclipse to run, GTK2 libraries and
their dependencies must be installed and available on the library path
(i.e. LIBPATH). These libraries are available from
http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/linux/toolbox/alpha.html
. To determine the full set of libraries required for installation,
download and install the "gtk2" rpm, at which time any missing
dependencies will be listed. These dependencies should be available for
download from the same site.</p>
<p>You can run Eclipse using the VM from IBM Developer Kit for AIX
versions 5 and 6. The IBM Developer Kit for AIX can be downloaded from:
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/aix/service.html</p>
<h4 id="SpecialOSRequirementsHPUX"><a class="mozTocH4"
 name="mozTocId83227"></a>HPUX</h4>
<p>In order for this version of Eclipse to run, GTK2 libraries must be
installed and available on the library path (i.e. LD_LIBRARY_PATH).</p>
<p>For example, export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/gtk_64bit/lib/hpux64/</p>
<p>To prevent errors with workspace locking, the following command line
should be used to launch Eclipse:</p>
<p>"eclipse -vmargs -Dosgi.locking=none"</p>
<p>Otherwise, eclipse may fail to create a lock file with reason:
"Workspace in use or cannot be created, choose a different one."</p>
<p>Note you might also need to add the -d64 option to the vmargs when
using an Oracle JRE. (-vmargs -d64)</p>
<h4 id="SpecialOSRequirementsSolaris"><a class="mozTocH4"
 name="mozTocId203915"></a>Solaris</h4>
<p>This version of Eclipse works best with the latest version of GTK+
2, but the earliest version supported is GTK+ 2.10.</p>
<p>The GTK libraries must be available on the library path (i.e.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH).</p>
<h2 id="Upgrading"><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId320201"></a>Upgrading
Workspace from a Previous Release</h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId35396"></a>Users who don't use
"-data"</h3>
<p>If you weren't previously using "-data" to specify your workspace,
follow these steps to upgrade:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find the workspace directory used by your old version of Eclipse.
Typically this is located inside the directory in which Eclipse was
installed in a sub-directory called "<code>workspace</code>". If you
are using a shortcut or script to launch Eclipse, then it will be under
the current working directory of that shortcut or script in a
sub-directory called "workspace". For Windows users, this is specified
by the "Start in:" argument in your shortcut properties. </li>
  <li>Copy this workspace directory to a new, empty location outside of
any Eclipse install directory.</li>
  <li>Install the new version of Eclipse in a new location, separate
from any old version of Eclipse.</li>
  <li>If you had installed additional features and plug-ins into your
old Eclipse, you should re-install them in the new Eclipse.</li>
  <li>Start this new version of Eclipse and select this location using
the workspace chooser dialog at startup (or use "<code>-data</code>"
command line argument to pre-select the workspace location). </li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId19126"></a>Users who do use
"-data"</h3>
<p> If you were previously using the " <code>-data</code> " argument
to start Eclipse, your upgrade path is much easier: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Optionally copy your workspace directory to a new, empty location
outside of any Eclipse install directory as a backup.</li>
  <li>Install the new version of Eclipse in a new location, separate
from any old versions of Eclipse.</li>
  <li>If you had installed additional features and plug-ins into your
old Eclipse, you should re-install them in the new Eclipse.</li>
  <li>Start this new version of Eclipse and select this location using
the workspace chooser dialog at startup (or use "<code>-data</code>"
command line argument to pre-select the workspace location). </li>
</ol>
<p> <i>Note:</i> Copying your workspace is recommended because, after
you've upgraded your workspace, you won't be able to use it again with
an older version of Eclipse. If you ever want to go "back in time" to
an earlier release, you will need that backup. </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId209647"></a>Users who use User
Libraries or classpath containers that contain JARs referencing other
libraries via Class-Path in the MANIFEST.MF</h3>
<p>If you want the referenced JAR files to be included in the
classpath, you can do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add the system property (<code>-DresolveReferencedLibrariesForContainers=true</code>)
to the <code>-vmargs</code> list on start-up, or </li>
  <li>Manually add the referenced JARs to the User Library or to the
project.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId682919"></a>Dropped in bundles
may not resolve after upgrade</h3>
<p> If you have installed bundles by dropping them into the <code>plugins</code>
or <code>dropins</code> directory, they might no longer resolve when
you upgrade to a new Eclipse Platform version. In each new version of
the Eclipse Platform, there are new versions of bundles included in the
platform, and often a small number of removed bundles. This may cause
your previously dropped in bundles to no longer resolve and run. It is
always recommended that you install software via the <code>Help &gt;
Install New Software</code> mechanism so you are made aware of any
install-time failure to resolve dependencies. </p>
<h2 id="InteroperabilityWithPreviousReleases"><a class="mozTocH2"
 name="mozTocId500419"></a>Interoperability with Previous Releases</h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId155846"></a>Interoperability of
Release 4.6 with previous releases</h3>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId676468"></a>Sharing projects
between heterogeneous Eclipse 4.6 and 4.5</h4>
<p>Special care is required when a project in a team repository is
being loaded and operated on by developers using Eclipse-based products
based on different feature or plug-in versions. The general problem is
that the existence, contents, and interpretation of metadata files in
the workspaces may be specific to a particular feature or plug-in
version, and differ between versions. The workspace compatibility
guarantees only cover cases where all developers upgrade their Eclipse
workspaces in lock step. In those cases there should be no problem with
shared metadata. However, when some developers are working in Eclipse
4.6 while others are working in Eclipse 3.x, there are no such
guarantees. This section provides advice for what to do and not to do.
It addresses the specific issues with the Eclipse SDK.</p>
<p>The typical failure mode is noticed by the 4.6 user. 4.6 metadata is
lost when a 4.5 user saves changes and then commits the updated
metadata files to the repository. Here's how things typically go awry:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A user working in Eclipse 4.6 creates or modifies a project in a
way that results in changes to a shared metadata file that rely on
4.6-specific information. The user then commits the updated project
files, including the shared metadata file, to the shared repository.</li>
  <li>Another user working in Eclipse 4.5 or earlier shares this
project from the same repository. The 4.6-specific information in the
shared metadata file is not understood by Eclipse 4.5, and is generally
discarded or ignored without warning. The user modifies the project in
a way that results in changes to the shared metadata file, causing the
shared metadata file to be rewritten without any of the 4.6-specific
information. The user commits the updated project files, including the
shared metadata file, to the shared repository. The user is generally
unaware that shared information has just been lost as a result of their
actions.</li>
  <li>A user working in Eclipse 4.6 picks up the changes to a project
from the shared repository, including the updated shared metadata file.
The user may be unaware that they have just taken a retrograde step
until later when things start to malfunction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some things to watch out for when sharing projects between
Eclipse 4.6 and earlier releases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Virtual folders</b> - Eclipse 4.6 supports a notion of <i>virtual
folders</i> that did not exist in Eclipse 3.5 or earlier. If such
virtual folders are created in 4.6, and the project is subsequently
loaded into an Eclipse 3.5 or earlier workspace, these folders will not
be recognized. Recommendation: avoid creating virtual folders where
project compatibility with Eclipse 3.5 or earlier is required.</li>
  <li><b>Resource filters</b> - Eclipse 4.6 supports a notion of <i>resource
filters</i> that did not exist in Eclipse 3.5 or earlier. If such
filters are added to resources in 4.6, and the project is subsequently
loaded into an Eclipse 3.5 or earlier workspace, these filters will not
be recognized. Recommendation: avoid creating resource filters where
project compatibility with Eclipse 3.5 or earlier is required.</li>
  <li><b>Predefined path variables</b> - Eclipse 4.6 supports a set of
built in path variables that can be used as the basis for linked
resource locations. Such variables will not be defined automatically in
Eclipse 3.5 or earlier. If compatibility with 3.5 or earlier workspace
is required, users on 3.5 or earlier workspaces will need to define
such path variables manually.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId538141"></a>Using Eclipse 4.6 to
develop plug-ins that work in Eclipse 4.5</h4>
<p> It is also possible (and reasonable) to use Eclipse 4.6 to develop
a plug-in intended to work in Eclipse 4.5 or earlier. Use the <b>Plug-in
Development &gt; Target Platform </b>preference page to locate
non-workspace plug-ins in an Eclipse 4.5 install. This ensures that the
code for your plug-in is being compiled and tested against Eclipse 4.5
APIs, extension points, and plug-ins. (The above list of concerns do
not apply since they affect the layout and interpretation of files in
the plug-in <i>project</i> but none affect the actual deployed form of
the plug-in.) </p>
