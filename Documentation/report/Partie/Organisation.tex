\chapter{Organization}

At the beginning of this internship I made many choices in the organization of my work. This chapter details those choices.


\section{Calendar}

First of all, in June, I made a calendar of my planning works. This calendar has given me a good overview of the time that I am allowed to spend in every task.

During the week 10, the University was closed.

\section{Record}

The main client of this project is Mr Champeau. So I did every week a record of my work by e-mail to him. In this e-mail I presented the work done during this week and the work planned for the next week. Whenever possible, I included a short video to present my improvements.

I also did a video conference with Mr Champeau and Mr Teodorov in the 1st of July. This video conference was very useful to know if I was on the right track and to clarify some important points.




\section{Tools used for the project}

After the begin of this project I decided to use some tools to arrange my work.
~\\

I employ Framaboard: a web application which permit to create kanban board\footnote{Kanban is a method for managing knowledge used by software teams practicing agile software development.\cite{wiki_kanban}}. I used it because that allow to have a good visual overview of the project. The Figure \ref{fig:framaboard} show my framaboard.

\end{figure}

Then the MSDL laboratory give me a web page to present my work and my progress. I also put on this web page a resume of all my records. The Figure \ref{fig:msdl} exhibit my personal web page.

\end{figure}


To finish they likewise give me an access to their git server. That permit to lodge my work on a secure server and prevent a data-loss in case my computer broke. Figure \ref{fig:git} shows my git repository.
