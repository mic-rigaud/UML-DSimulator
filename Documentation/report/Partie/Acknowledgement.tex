First of all, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Professor Hans Vangheluwe and Mr Simon Van Mierlo, my research supervisors, for their patient guidance, enthusiastic encouragement and useful critiques of this research work. I would also like to thank Professor Champeau, for his advice and for giving me the opportunity to do this internship. My grateful thanks are also extended to Professor Teodorov for his help in the manipulation of his simulator.

I would also like to extend my thanks to all members of the MSDL laboratory for their help in offering me the resources in running the program, and their welcome. And more particularly to Yentl Van Tendeloo for his technical help and Claudio Gon√ßalves Gomes for taking time to read my report.

%Finally, I wish to thank my parents for their support and encouragement throughout my study.
