As it was explain in the introduction, the issue of this project is to propose a visualization of UML Model for \umld.

\section{Short term issue}

In short term, this plugin should permit at Mr. Champeau and Mr. Teodorov to use during their classroom an free alternative and multi-platform of Rhapsody: \umld. In this way, every student can install on their own computer the tool use in classroom.

Advantages of \umld compare to Rhapsody: free, open source, work on Windows, Linux, and Apple.

\section{Long term issue}

Because this plugin is open source and downloadable on Github, it will be use by everybody. My hope is this plugin will be improve by the community, student, teacher, \etc... and became a serious alternative to Rhapsody and Papyrus.
