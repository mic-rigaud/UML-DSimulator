The Modelling, Simulation and Design lab (MSDL) headed by Prof. Hans Vangheluwe is part of the School of Computer Science of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and of the AnSyMo (Antwerp Systems and software Modelling) group in the department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium. The MSDL has projects, researchers and students in both locations.\cite{msdl}

\section{My position in the university}

My stage chief was Prof. Hans Vangheluwe\footnote{Prof. Hans Vangheluwe: \url{http://msdl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/hv/}}. But, because he is always busy and not always in the university for professional reason, I was attached to Simon Van Mierlo\footnote{Simon Van Mierlo: \url{http://msdl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/simonvm/}} for this internship. He is a PhD student at the University of Antwerp. He works on the simulator of Statechart SCCD and he create a debugger for this simulator.

Simon has been my tutor because first of all my work was very similar at a debugger interface and because Prof. Vangheluwe expected that I use SCCD as simulator and compare it with the simulator of Mr. Teodorov.

I work during my internship in the office of Simon and Yentl Van Tendeloo\footnote{Yentl Van Tendeloo: \url{http://msdl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/yentl/}}
